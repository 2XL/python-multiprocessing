# Multiprocessing in python


## Description

This package is a test on multiprocessing on python, using the core library called *multiprocessing*.
This includes some tests depicting the specific API and behavior.

This package also includes the [py_ecc](http://web.mit.edu/~emin/www.old/source_code/py_ecc/), which
provides an implementation in python of the Reed Salomon erasure code.

Altogether will serve as the basis for several practical work in the subject **Distributed System Architectures**
at the **[Universitat Rovira i Virgili](http://www.urv.cat)**.


## Goal

Build some proof of concepts of multiprocessing in python, and knowing the limitations of the
library *multiprocessing* (such as forced uniform distribution of jobs among workers). Show
a use case for the py_ecc Reed Salomon implementation.


## py_ecc

py_ecc is distributed under a GPL-compliant license and therefore is also included in this package.
You may find the last version under http://web.mit.edu/~emin/www.old/source_code/py_ecc/ and
